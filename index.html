								<h3>John Steinbeck</h3>
								His origins are clouded in mystery, but the Death Guard in his Warband claim, Felthius was once a slave that was dropped in the noxious pits of the Plague Planet. Most who suffer such a fate experience horrid deaths, but Felthius thrived and eventually earned the right to join the ranks of the Death Guard. No one but he knows if this is true, but since his rise hundreds of years ago, Felthius has become a powerful and effective commander. He has led the Tainted Sons to victory over the armies of dozens of Imperial worlds and has captured an Emperor's Spears Strike Cruiser, which became his flagship Rotbringer. In battles, Felthius can be found where the fighting is the thickest, and each of his victories bring him one step closer to becoming a Daemon Prince.

								<h3>Fyodor Dostoevsky</h3>
								<p>
									Malignant Plaguecasters are Chaos Sorcerers of Nurgle. Often serving in the Death Guard Legion, they wield diseased magic and wield a Corrupted Staff and Blight Grenades.

									Potent Death Guard Sorcerers, these vile psykers are warp-rotted from their pallid, flyblown skin to their ever-churning innards. They have bargained away what remained of their souls in exchange for Nurgle’s blessings, and been gifted with the ability to channel the malaise of the Plague God’s realm.

									The bloated bodies of Malignant Plaguecasters have become living conduits for the Garden of Nurgle’s toxic miasmas. Flesh-eating spore clouds, droning plague flies, vomitous mists and plague-laden corpse gas roil within the Plaguecasters’ guts, at times straining their skin to bursting point. With retching exhalations, the Plaguecasters blow these lethal clouds across the battlefield. Around a Plaguecaster, warriors collapse, choking upon their own rotting lungs even as their flesh blackens and liquefies. Armor corrodes and weapons malfunction as they are eaten away. Even sealed fortifications offer no protection.
